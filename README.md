# Local Verity Terraform Provider Setup

## Building the Provider

To compile the provider binary, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-verity
```

If you are using windows...

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-verity.exe
```


## Provider Configuration

### Custom Provider Binary

To use a local development version of the provider, you need to configure Terraform to use your custom provider binary instead of downloading it from the registry. This is done using a `.tfrc` configuration file. Here's an example (`dev.tfrc`):

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/local/verity" = "/home/<user>/terraform-provider-verity"
  }
  direct {}
}
```
(Note: if using windows pay attention to the windows format for director naming)

Then in your Terraform configuration file, specify the local provider:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    verity = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/local/verity"
    }
  }
}

provider "verity" {
  uri      = var.uri
  username = var.username
  password = var.password
}
```


To use this configuration, you can either:
- Copy it to `~/.terraformrc`
- Set the `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to point to your custom `.tfrc` file:
  ```bash
  export TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=/home/<user>/terraform-provider-verity/examples/dev.tfrc
  ```
  For Windows:
  ```powershell
  $env:TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE="C:\path\to\terraform-provider-verity\examples\dev.tfrc"
  ```

### Required Environment Variables

The provider requires several environment variables to be set for authentication. You can set these variables manually or use a script like `set_env.sh`:

```bash
export TF_VAR_uri="<your-verity-uri>"
export TF_VAR_username="<your-username>"
export TF_VAR_password="<your-password>"
```

For Windows, use the following commands to set environment variables:

```powershell
$env:TF_VAR_uri="<your-verity-uri>"
$env:TF_VAR_username="<your-username>"
$env:TF_VAR_password="<your-password>"
```

These variables correspond to the provider configuration in your Terraform files:

```hcl
provider "verity" {
  uri      = var.uri
  username = var.username
  password = var.password
}
```

Make sure to set these environment variables before running any Terraform commands. (Of course, windows is different...)


## Production Setup

For production use, configure Terraform to download the provider from the registry:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    verity = {
      source  = "BE-Network/verity"
      version = "1.0.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "verity" {
  uri      = var.uri
  username = var.username
  password = var.password
}
```

> Replace `1.0.3` with the desired release version.

## Recommended Environment Variables

By default, Terraform is only able to handle 10 resources at a time. It is recommended to export the following environment variable to allow the provider to make bulk requests to the API instead of splitting the API calls into multiple ones:

### Unix-based Systems
```bash
export TF_CLI_ARGS_apply="-parallelism=250"
```

### Windows
```powershell
$env:TF_CLI_ARGS_apply="-parallelism=250"
```

## Regenerating the OpenAPI Go SDK

If there are changes to the Verity API (reflected in a new swagger.json file), you'll need to regenerate the OpenAPI Go SDK. Follow these steps:

1. Save the new swagger.json file

2. Run the tools/transform_swagger.py script to prepare the swagger file for code generation:
   ```bash
   python3 tools/transform_swagger.py swagger.json
   ```

3. Install the OpenAPI Generator CLI (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
   ```

4. Generate the Go SDK using openapi-generator-cli:
   ```bash
   openapi-generator-cli generate -i swagger_transformed.json -g go -o ./openapi
   ```

5. Replace the existing openapi folder with the newly generated one

### Updating Provider Resource Files

After regenerating the SDK, you need to update the provider resource files:

- For fields deleted from the API: Remove them from the corresponding provider resource files
- For new fields added to the API: Add them to the appropriate provider resource files

## Using the State Import Scripts

The provider includes scripts to help import existing Verity resources into Terraform state. These scripts automate the process of creating resource files and importing existing resources.

### Resource Dependency Management

The import process creates a special `stages.tf` file that defines explicit dependency ordering for resources. This uses the `verity_operation_stage` resource, which helps to:

1. Establish a clear sequence for creating, updating, and destroying resources
2. Prevent dependency conflicts between resource types
3. Ensure that resources are processed in the optimal order for the Verity API

Each imported resource is configured with the appropriate `depends_on` attribute referring to its corresponding stage. This prevents Terraform from attempting to create resources before their dependencies are ready, which is particularly important when working with the Verity API's interdependent resources.

The operation stages maintain the following order for creation and update operations:

1. tenant_stage
2. gateway_stage
3. gateway_profile_stage
4. service_stage
5. eth_port_profile_stage
6. eth_port_settings_stage
7. lag_stage
8. bundle_stage

For delete operations, this order is automatically reversed (8â†’1) to ensure proper dependency handling when removing resources.

#### Creating New Resources

When manually creating new resources (not through import), it's strongly recommended to follow the same pattern and include the appropriate `depends_on` attribute referring to the corresponding stage. For example:

```hcl
resource "verity_tenant" "example" {
  name = "example-tenant"
  // other attributes...
  depends_on = [verity_operation_stage.tenant_stage]
}

resource "verity_service" "example" {
  name = "example-service"
  // other attributes...
  depends_on = [verity_operation_stage.service_stage]
}
```

This ensures proper ordering of operations and helps avoid dependency issues when managing your infrastructure.

### What the Scripts Do

1. Find the main Terraform file with the Verity provider
2. Add the `verity_state_importer` data source if it doesn't exist
3. Run a first `terraform apply` to generate resource files and import blocks
4. Run a second `terraform apply` to import the resources into your state
5. Clean up temporary files

### Running the Scripts

#### Linux and macOS

```bash
# Production
.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/be-network/verity/<VERSION>/<OS>_<ARCH>/tools/import_verity_state.sh

# Local (skip terraform init)
../tools/import_verity_state.sh --local
```

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
# Production
.terraform\providers\registry.terraform.io\be-network\verity\<VERSION>\<OS>_<ARCH>\tools\import_verity_state.ps1

# Local (skip terraform init)
..\tools\import_verity_state.ps1 -Local
```

> **Note:** Replace:
> - `<VERSION>` with the actual provider version (e.g. `1.0.3`)
> - `<OS>` with your operating system (e.g. `linux`, `windows`, `darwin`)
> - `<ARCH>` with your CPU architecture (e.g. `amd64`, `arm64`)

### Prerequisites

- Terraform must be installed and in your PATH
- Your Terraform files must include a Verity provider configuration
- Environment variables for authentication must be set (see "Required Environment Variables" section)
